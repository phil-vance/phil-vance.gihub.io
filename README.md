Project to assess CMS data for value based programs and hospital readmissions.  Data is used by CMS to determine reimbursements for facilities treating Medicare and Medicaid patients.  Excess readmission ratio (ERR) is the relative amount of readmissions a facility sees beyond what it should based on compariable facilities and severity of patients seen.  Mean spending per beneficiary (MSPB) is the standardized amount of resources utilized to treat a patient.  ERR and MSPB data is evaluated to identify differences between organization types, severity of patient populations, and directly between ERR and MSPB scores.
